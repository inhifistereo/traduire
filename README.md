# Traduire 

## Overview 
This is an application to demonstrates various Azure services. It will transcribe an audio podcast (up to 50mb in size) to text using Azure Cognitive Services. It uses the Saga pattern and Virtual Actors to manage the transcription process.  It uses [Dapr](https://dapr.io) as the distributive runtime to manage communication between the various service components. The application exposes both a REST API consumed by a React-based UI and a gRPC API consumed by a commandline application

## Languages
* C# and dotnet 5 
* PowerShell
* Hashicorp Terraform

## Deployment

### Prerequisite 
__Or use DevContainer__
* A Linux machine or Windows Subsytem for Linux or Docker for Windows 
* PowerShell 7
* Azure Cli and an Azure Subscription
* Terraform 0.12 or greater
* Kubectl
* Helm 3 or greater
* Docker 

### Infrastructure 
* pwsh
* cd ./Infrastructure
* ./create_infrastructure.ps1 -Subscription BJD_AZ_SUB01 -Region southcentralus

### Application Deployment 
* pwsh
* cd ./Deploy
* ./deploy_application.ps1 -AppName $AppName -Subscription BJD_AZ_SUB01 -Uri api.bjd.tech -FrontEndUri traduire.bjd.tech [-upgrade] -verbose
* Update the DNS record of Uri to the IP Address returned by the script

### UI Deployment 
* pwsh
* cd ./Deploy
* ./deploy_ui.ps1 -AppName $AppName -ApiUri api.bjd.tech -Verbose

## Validate 

### Web Application
* Install [Playwright](https://playwright.dev)
* cd tests
* ./run-tests.sh traduire.bjd.tech #Or whatever your default Url from Azure Static Web Apps 

_Manually_
* Launch Browser
* Navigate to the URI outputed by the deploy_ui.ps1
    * Azure Static Website supports custom domain names, if desired. 
* Select and upload assets\recording.m4a
* Click 'Check Status' to watch the transcription go through its stages 
* Then the final result should be: \
    ![UI](./assets/ui.png)*

### gRPC API 
* cd sample\grpc.client
* dotnet build 
* dontet run /ApiServer https://api.bjd.tech /ApiKey {{apikey}}
    * API Key is stored as a Secret in Kubernetes

## Backlog 
- [X] Add null_resource to bin Keda's identity to cluster
- [X] Test Cluster creation with new Terraform and Flux extension
- [X] Update Helm Chart - Service Accounts/Deployments 
- [X] Test applciation deployment
- [X] Validate application functionality
- [ ] Update to Workload Identity when support comes to Dapr
